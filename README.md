# PewPew + MicroQiskit

If you want to do some quantum computing, you'll need some software and some hardware. The best software is [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), an open-source Python-based framework. The best place to get your hands on hardware is the [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com).

But maybe all that's a little too advanced for your first step into this new world...

Instead of using the most well-developed framework for quantum computing &mdash; full to the brim with fancy features &mdash; maybe something more minimal is best to start off with. And instead of using trying to push the world's most advanced quantum devices to their limits, your first programs will be much more limited in scope. Much easier just to use a simple emulator. With these ideas in mind, we bring you [MicroQiskit](https://github.com/qiskit-community/MicroQiskit). This let's you play with the basics of quantum computing, in the most straightforward way possible.

Now what will you do with MicroQiskit? What will be your first attempt at writing a quantum program. My suggestion is to make a game! Just try using one or two qubits to implement a simple game mechanic. To get a bit of context on why this is a good idea, check out the following.

The usual way to make a game is using and engine like [Unity](https://unity.com/) or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). However, when learning to use Qiskit (or MicroQiskit), it's better to use a Python-based game engine.
